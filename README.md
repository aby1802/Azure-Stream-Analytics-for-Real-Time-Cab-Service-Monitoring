# Azure-Stream-Analytics-for-Real-Time-Cab-Service-Monitoring
Business Overview

The process of analyzing and measuring data as soon as it enters the database is referred to as real-time analytics.  Thus, users gain insights or may draw conclusions as soon as data enters their system. Businesses can react quickly using real-time analytics. They have the ability to grasp opportunities and avert issues before they occur.

Batch-style analytics, on the other hand, might take hours or even days to provide findings. As a result, batch analytical systems frequently produce only static insights based on lagging indications. Real-time analytics insights may help organizations stay ahead of the competition. These pipelines for streaming data generally follow a 3 step process, i.e., Ingest, Analyze and Deliver.

In this project, we will address the problem of Real-Time cab service monitoring. Usage of cab services like Uber, Ola, etc., are increasing day by day, and they have become a part of the regular commute. The architecture diagram given is a replica of how these companies monitor their real-time booking service via the Power BI dashboard.

Data Pipeline

A data pipeline is a method of moving information from one system to another. The information may or may not be updated, and it may be processed in real-time (or streaming) rather than in batches. The data pipeline includes everything from gathering data through multiple ways to storing raw data, cleaning, verifying, and transforming data into a query-able format, showing KPIs, and overseeing the entire process
